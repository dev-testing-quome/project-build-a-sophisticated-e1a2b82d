# Deployment Guide - project-build-a-sophisticated

This guide outlines the deployment process for "project-build-a-sophisticated," a contract review and management platform.  This guide assumes familiarity with command-line interfaces, Docker, and at least one cloud provider (AWS, GCP, or Azure).

## Prerequisites

### Required Software and Tools

* **Docker:**  Version 20.10.0 or higher.
* **Docker Compose:** Version 1.29.0 or higher.
* **Git:** For source code management.
* **Cloud Provider Account:** AWS, GCP, or Azure account (choose one).  Appropriate IAM/permissions setup is crucial.
* **Text Editor/IDE:** For editing configuration files.
* **Database Client:** (e.g., pgAdmin for PostgreSQL, MySQL Workbench for MySQL)

### System Requirements

* **Development:**  8GB RAM, 4-core CPU, 20GB free disk space.  Requirements will scale with production load.
* **Production:**  Resources will depend heavily on expected load. Consider using a cloud provider's scaling capabilities.  Start with 16GB RAM, 8-core CPU, 100GB free disk space and scale as needed.

### Account Setup

* **Cloud Provider:** Create an account with your chosen cloud provider (AWS, GCP, or Azure). Set up billing and appropriate IAM roles with necessary permissions.
* **Database:** Create a database instance (PostgreSQL, MySQL, or similar) on your chosen cloud provider or on-premises.  Note the connection details (hostname, port, username, password, database name).

## Environment Setup

### Environment Variables Configuration

Create a `.env` file at the root of your project directory. This file will contain sensitive information like database credentials and API keys.  **Do not commit this file to version control.**

```
DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:password@host:port/database
SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
# ... other environment variables ...
```

### Database Setup

1. **Create the database:** Use your database client to create the database specified in your `.env` file.
2. **Run migrations:** (See Database Setup section below for migration commands).

### External Service Configuration

Configure any external services your application uses (e.g., email service, authentication provider, electronic signature provider).  Credentials for these services should also be stored securely in your `.env` file.

## Docker Deployment

### Building the Docker Image

Navigate to the project's root directory and run:

```bash
docker-compose build
```

### Running with Docker Compose

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

This command builds and starts all containers defined in your `docker-compose.yml` file.  Ensure your `docker-compose.yml` file includes appropriate volumes for data persistence.  Example:

```yaml
version: "3.9"
services:
  web:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "8000:8000" # Example port mapping
    volumes:
      - ./data:/app/data # Example data volume
  db:
    image: postgres:14
    environment:
      - POSTGRES_USER=user
      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password
      - POSTGRES_DB=database
    volumes:
      - ./db_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
```

### Environment Configuration

Docker Compose will automatically load environment variables from the `.env` file.

### Health Checks and Monitoring

Implement health checks within your application and use Docker Compose's healthcheck option to monitor container health.  Consider using a monitoring tool (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana) for more comprehensive monitoring.

## Production Deployment

### Cloud Deployment Options

* **AWS:** Use ECS, EKS, or EC2.
* **GCP:** Use GKE, Cloud Run, or Compute Engine.
* **Azure:** Use AKS, Azure Container Instances, or Virtual Machines.

Choose the option that best suits your needs and scale requirements.

### Container Orchestration

* **Kubernetes (K8s):**  Deploy your Docker images to a Kubernetes cluster using tools like `kubectl`.
* **Docker Swarm:**  Deploy your Docker images to a Docker Swarm cluster.

K8s is generally preferred for larger-scale deployments due to its advanced features.

### Load Balancing and Scaling

Use your cloud provider's load balancing service to distribute traffic across multiple instances of your application. Configure auto-scaling to automatically increase or decrease the number of instances based on demand.

### SSL/TLS Configuration

Obtain an SSL/TLS certificate from a provider like Let's Encrypt and configure your load balancer or reverse proxy to use it.

## Database Setup

### Database Migration Commands

Use a database migration tool (e.g., Alembic for SQLAlchemy) to manage database schema changes.  Commands will vary depending on the tool used.  Example (Alembic):

```bash
alembic upgrade head
```

### Initial Data Setup

Populate the database with initial data using SQL scripts or your application's data seeding mechanisms.

### Backup and Recovery Procedures

Regularly back up your database.  Your cloud provider likely offers backup services.  Establish a clear recovery procedure in case of data loss.

## Monitoring & Logging

### Application Monitoring Setup

Use a monitoring tool (e.g., Prometheus, Datadog, New Relic) to monitor application performance and resource usage.

### Log Aggregation

Use a centralized logging system (e.g., Elasticsearch, Fluentd, Kibana - the ELK stack) to collect and analyze logs from all application components.

### Performance Monitoring

Monitor key performance indicators (KPIs) like response times, request rates, and error rates.

### Error Tracking

Use an error tracking tool (e.g., Sentry, Rollbar) to capture and analyze application errors.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Deployment Issues

* **Connection errors:** Check database credentials, network connectivity, and firewall rules.
* **Application errors:** Check application logs for error messages.
* **Resource exhaustion:** Monitor resource usage (CPU, memory, disk space) and scale up resources if necessary.

### Debug Commands

Use your debugger (e.g., pdb in Python) to debug application code.  Check your container logs using `docker logs <container_id>`.

### Log Locations

Log locations vary depending on the application and logging configuration.  Refer to your application's documentation.

### Recovery Procedures

* **Database recovery:** Restore from a backup.
* **Application recovery:** Restart containers or deploy a new version.


## Security Considerations

### Environment Variable Security

Never hardcode sensitive information in your code.  Use environment variables and secure secrets management services provided by your cloud provider.

### Network Security

Use firewalls and other network security measures to protect your application from unauthorized access.

### Authentication Setup

Implement robust authentication mechanisms (e.g., OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect) to secure access to your application.

### Regular Security Updates

Regularly update your application and its dependencies to patch security vulnerabilities.  Employ automated vulnerability scanning tools.


This guide provides a high-level overview.  Specific commands and configurations will depend on your chosen technologies and infrastructure.  Remember to adapt this guide to your specific needs and always prioritize security best practices.
