# Developer Setup Guide - project-build-a-sophisticated

This guide outlines the setup process for developers working on "project-build-a-sophisticated," a contract review and management platform.

## Prerequisites

* **Required Software Versions:**
    * Python 3.9+
    * Node.js 16+
    * Docker Desktop (for Option 1)
    * PostgreSQL 13+ (or your preferred database, adjustments needed in configuration)
* **Development Tools:**
    * Git
    * A text editor or IDE (VS Code, IntelliJ IDEA recommended)
* **IDE Recommendations and Configurations:**
    * **VS Code:** Install extensions for Python, JavaScript, Docker, and PostgreSQL support.  Configure linters (e.g., Pylint, ESLint) and formatters (e.g., Black, Prettier) based on project configurations.
    * **IntelliJ IDEA:**  Similar to VS Code, install relevant plugins for Python, JavaScript, Docker, and Database integration.  Configure code style and formatting according to project standards.


## Local Development Setup

### Option 1: Docker Development (Recommended)

1. **Clone Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd project-build-a-sophisticated
   ```

2. **Docker Setup Commands:** Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed and running.

3. **Development docker-compose Configuration:**  A `docker-compose.yml` file should be present in the root directory.  It defines the services (database, backend, frontend). Example:

   ```yaml
   version: "3.9"
   services:
     db:
       image: postgres:13
       environment:
         - POSTGRES_USER=your_db_user
         - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=your_db_password
         - POSTGRES_DB=your_db_name
       ports:
         - "5432:5432"
     backend:
       build: ./backend
       ports:
         - "8000:8000"
       depends_on:
         - db
       environment:
         - DATABASE_URL=postgres://your_db_user:your_db_password@db:5432/your_db_name
     frontend:
       build: ./frontend
       ports:
         - "3000:3000"
       depends_on:
         - backend
   ```

4. **Hot Reload Setup:**  This depends on your frontend framework (React, Vue, etc.).  Use tools like `nodemon` (for backend) and webpack dev server (for frontend) or similar solutions provided by your framework.


### Option 2: Native Development

1. **Backend Setup:**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r backend/requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Frontend Setup:**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```

3. **Database Setup:** Install PostgreSQL. Create a database and user as specified in the `.env` file (see next section).  You might need to use `psql` to create the database manually.


## Environment Configuration

* **Required Environment Variables:**  The `.env` file should contain:
    * `DATABASE_URL`:  The connection string for your database (e.g., `postgres://user:password@localhost:5432/database_name`).
    * `SECRET_KEY`: A secret key for security (generate a strong random key).
    * `DEBUG`:  Set to `true` for development, `false` for production.
    * Other application-specific settings (API keys, etc.).

* **Local Development `.env` File Setup:** Create a `.env` file in the root directory and populate it with your development environment variables. **Never commit this file to version control!** Add it to your `.gitignore`.

* **Configuration for Different Environments:** Use environment variables to manage configurations for development, testing, staging, and production.  Consider using a configuration management system (e.g., environment variables, configuration files) to handle these differences.


## Running the Application

* **Start Commands for Development:**
    * **Docker:** `docker-compose up -d`
    * **Native:** Start the backend server (e.g., `python manage.py runserver` if using Django) and the frontend development server (e.g., `npm start`).

* **How to Access Frontend and Backend:** The frontend will typically be accessible at `http://localhost:3000` and the backend API at `http://localhost:8000`.  The exact ports depend on your `docker-compose.yml` or development server configurations.

* **API Documentation Access:**  If using tools like Swagger or OpenAPI, access the documentation through a specified endpoint (e.g., `/docs`).


## Development Workflow

* **Git Workflow and Branching Strategy:** Use Gitflow or a similar branching strategy (feature branches, pull requests).

* **Code Formatting and Linting Setup:** Configure linters (e.g., Pylint, ESLint) and formatters (e.g., Black, Prettier) to enforce consistent code style.  These are usually integrated into your IDE.

* **Testing Procedures:** Write unit and integration tests.  Use a testing framework (e.g., pytest for Python, Jest for JavaScript).

* **Debugging Setup:** Use your IDE's debugger or tools like `pdb` (Python Debugger) or browser developer tools.


## Database Management

* **Running Migrations:** Use database migration tools (e.g., Alembic for SQLAlchemy) to manage schema changes.

* **Seeding Development Data:** Create scripts to populate the database with sample data for development and testing.

* **Database Reset Procedures:** Implement scripts to easily reset the database to a clean state.


## Testing

* **Running Unit Tests:** Use your chosen testing framework's command (e.g., `pytest` or `npm test`).

* **Running Integration Tests:** Similar to unit tests, but focus on interactions between components.

* **Test Coverage Reports:** Generate reports to track test coverage using tools like `coverage` (Python) or `nyc` (JavaScript).


## Common Development Tasks

* **Adding New API Endpoints:**  Follow the backend framework's guidelines for creating new routes and handlers.

* **Adding New Frontend Components:**  Use your frontend framework's component system to create new UI elements.

* **Database Schema Changes:** Use migrations to manage changes to the database schema.

* **Adding Dependencies:** Use `pip` (Python) or `npm` (JavaScript) to add new libraries.


## Troubleshooting

* **Common Setup Issues:** Check the logs for errors.  Ensure all dependencies are installed correctly.

* **Port Conflicts Resolution:** Change ports in your configuration files if ports are already in use.

* **Dependency Issues:** Carefully review your `requirements.txt` (Python) or `package.json` (JavaScript) files to resolve dependency conflicts.

* **Environment Variable Problems:** Double-check that your environment variables are set correctly.


## Contributing

* **Code Style Guidelines:** Adhere to the project's code style guidelines (e.g., PEP 8 for Python, Airbnb style guide for JavaScript).

* **Pull Request Process:** Create pull requests for code changes, ensuring thorough testing and code review.

* **Issue Reporting:** Report bugs and feature requests using the project's issue tracker.


This guide provides a comprehensive starting point.  Specific commands and configurations might vary depending on the project's chosen technologies and frameworks.  Always refer to the project's documentation for detailed instructions.
