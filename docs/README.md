# project-build-a-sophisticated

## Overview

`project-build-a-sophisticated` is a sophisticated contract review and management platform designed to streamline the contract lifecycle for legal teams.  It provides a collaborative environment for analyzing contracts, managing versions, tracking approvals, and ensuring compliance.  The platform integrates markup tools, version control, collaborative editing, clause libraries, risk assessment features, electronic signatures, and robust security measures.  It also offers comprehensive reporting and analytics capabilities.

## Features

**User-Facing Functionality:**

* **Contract Upload & Review:** Upload contracts in various formats (PDF, DOCX, etc.) and review them using integrated markup tools.
* **Version Control:** Track all revisions and revert to previous versions as needed. Detailed revision history is maintained.
* **Collaborative Editing:**  Enable multiple users to simultaneously edit and comment on contracts.  Supports suggestion tracking and resolution.
* **Clause Libraries & Templates:** Utilize pre-defined clauses and standard templates to accelerate contract creation.
* **Risk Assessment & Compliance:** Identify potential risks and ensure compliance with relevant regulations.
* **Approval Workflows:** Manage contract approval processes with electronic signatures and customizable workflows.
* **Secure Storage:** Store contracts in a secure, searchable database with encryption and access controls.
* **Reporting & Analytics:** Generate reports and visualizations on contract terms, performance, and key metrics.
* **Role-Based Permissions:** Control access to contracts and features based on user roles (reviewer, approver, administrator).


**Technical Highlights:**

* **FastAPI backend:**  Provides a high-performance, robust, and easy-to-maintain API.
* **React frontend:** Offers a modern and user-friendly interface.
* **SQLite database:** Provides a lightweight and efficient database solution for local development (consider PostgreSQL or other robust solutions for production).
* **Docker containerization:** Enables easy deployment and consistent environment across different systems.
* **Comprehensive API documentation:**  Clearly documented endpoints for easy integration with other systems.


## Technology Stack

* **Backend**: FastAPI (Python 3.11+), SQLAlchemy ORM
* **Frontend**: React with TypeScript
* **Database**: SQLite (with potential for PostgreSQL/other DBs in production)
* **Containerization**: Docker


## Prerequisites

* Python 3.11 or higher
* Node.js 18 or higher
* npm
* Docker (optional, but recommended for deployment)
* Git


## Installation

### Local Development

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd project-build-a-sophisticated

# Backend setup
cd backend
python -m venv .venv  # Using .venv for clarity, avoid overwriting existing venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Frontend setup
cd ../frontend
npm install

# Start the application
# Backend (from backend directory)
uvicorn main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000

# Frontend (from frontend directory)
npm run dev
```

### Docker Setup

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

## API Documentation

Once the application is running, access the API documentation at:

* **API Documentation:** http://localhost:8000/docs
* **Alternative API Docs:** http://localhost:8000/redoc


## Usage

**Key Endpoints (Examples):**

* `/contracts`:  GET to retrieve a list of contracts, POST to create a new contract.
* `/contracts/{contract_id}`: GET to retrieve a specific contract, PUT to update a contract, DELETE to delete a contract.
* `/users`: Manage user accounts and permissions.
* `/approvals`: Manage contract approval workflows.


**Sample Request (GET /contracts):**

```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:8000/contracts
```

**Sample Response (GET /contracts):**

```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Sample Contract 1",
    "status": "Pending Approval"
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "name": "Sample Contract 2",
    "status": "Approved"
  }
]
```

**Common Workflows:**  Refer to the API documentation for detailed workflows on contract creation, review, approval, and reporting.
